# Start with a single host which will bootstrap the cluster. Once the
# cluster is bootstrapped we can set BOOTSTRAP_HOST and scale up
# more Consul instances.
# By using automatic bootstrapping via `-bootstrap-expect` and adding
# the environment variable, we can avoid having to use links. The
# environment variable is used once at bootstrap and then forever
# discarded by that node.
